1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Start a simple web server:**
   Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. **Open the game in your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.

That's it! The game will start, and you can begin playing immediately.
